bitbucket-issues-to-github
==========================

A simple tool written as C# console application to migrate your issues from a Bitbucket (private or public) to GitHub (private or public) repository.

> This is very raw but I just wanted to get this out somewhere. Right now, there is no docs and how to get started steps. You are just on your own :) In fact, you cannot even pass your parameters as command line arguments. You need to dig into the code and set the necessary parameters. So, please ***use this with caution***.
